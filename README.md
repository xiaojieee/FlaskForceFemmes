<h1>Welcome to our app Story Safari 🌴</h1>
<p>🤠 Story Safari is an application that can be used by both students and teachers.</p>
<p>👩‍🏫 Teachers can use the app to see what book their students are currently reading.</p>
<p>📚 Students can use the app to track their reading progress.</p>
<br>
<h2>💻 How to use our app</h2>
<p>For our app to run, check in the /application/static/sql_scripts folder.</p>
<p>Run the following scripts in this order in MySQL Workbench 🐬:</p>
<p>⚡ book_tracker_table.sql</p>
<p>⚡ inserts_book_tracker_table.sql</p>
<p>⚡ stored_procedures.sql</p>
<br>
<p>💡 Create the stored procedures one by one, start highlighting from the comment that says <b>-- START HIGHLIGHT</b> and end the highlight at the comment <b>-- END HIGHLIGHT</b> before running the lightning ⚡ on it.</p>
<br>
<p>❗ Please note that we have 8 stored procedures altogether.</p>
<br>
<p>✔️ After the database is created, run the app.py and our Flask application should be fully functioning.</p>
<p>🚩 Any errors with the app, feel free to flag it up with the repo contributors and we will do our best to resolve them.</p>
